# Navify Elements for Progressive Web Apps

This project is a growing collection of pre-built UI experiences for Web APIs such
as camera/video, focused on building Progressive Web Apps that meet and exceed
native mobile app experiences.

These elements are a key part of our mission to build the Progressive Web App OS
by providing awesome UIs on top of low-level Web APIs.

These components are built as Web Components that can be used in any web app, using
the power of [Rindo JS](https://rindojs.web.app/).

## Currently Supported

Currently, the project offers a quality in-app Camera experience using
`getUserMedia`, with support for multiple cameras and with automatic handling
of image data.

## Jigra Usage

Navify PWA Elements were built primarily for developers using [Jigra](https://jigrajs.web.app/),
our Native app container that allows web apps to run on nearly every platform
with consistent APIs.

Navify PWA Elements offer web-UI experiences for Jigra apps running in a browser
as PWA, such that the API is identical for the PWA and the native app store app.
